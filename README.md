# Stock Analysis

This analysis utilizes for loops and conditionals to loop through stock market data from 2018. Through the refactoring older code that could only run through a dozen stocks for each analysis, the code now can run for any number of stocks, as long as the index for the tickers array is changed to the desired number of stocks. The data presented in the All Stocks Analysis page comes from a series of three arrays created to increase efficiency. The code also compiles data for each stock through the variable tickerIndex, which sifts through each row to categorize the pricing data for each stock. Now, we can manipulate the code so that it runs through data only once, no matter how many stocks are present in the dataset, by clicking on the "Run Analysis for All" button I have created through VBA.
